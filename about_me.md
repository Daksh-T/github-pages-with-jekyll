Hi! I am Daksh.

I am a high school student who is currently ~3 years away from graduation. I started this blog as a way to express ideas and build a habit of writing. As you can likely determine from the place this blog is hosted, I am primarily interested in computer science. However, recently I have come to enjoy music making as well. I haven't made much progress 'professionally' on that front but I love to make random melodies here and there. I also love reading. Actually, I have loved reading since my childhood. One of my first loves was the Harry Potter series. I absolutely loved Harry Potter and I still have the paperbacks with me like treasured possessions. On that note, I started this blog: to become a writer myself and to share my experiences through this beautiful medium.

You can find my other projects on my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/Daksh-T)
